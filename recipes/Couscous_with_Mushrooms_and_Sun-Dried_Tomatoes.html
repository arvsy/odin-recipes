        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>This Couscous with Mushrooms and Sun-Dried Tomatoes is such an easy dish to make and has some 
      of the tastiest ingredients. I just love how fluffy the texture is and how much flavor is packed 
      into it. Sun-dried tomatoes rehydrated in broth or water have an intense sweet, tart taste, and the 
      the melted butter adds richness. Combine them with briny feta cheese and fresh herbs, and this recipe is scrumptious.</p>
    <p>This dish complements proteins and vegetables well, so pair it with your favorite dishes, or see
       some of my suggestions below. You can enjoy it hot or cold as well. I love this as a quick snack 
       or side dish for a bigger meal. Let's look at what you'll need to prepare it.</p>
    <h3>INGRIDIENTS (Serving Size : 4)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup dehydrated sun-dried tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
      <li>½ (10 ounce) package couscous</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
      <li>1 bunch green onions, chopped</li>
      <li>⅓ cup fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li>¼ cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
      <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>4 ounces portobello mushroom caps, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the sun-dried tomatoes in a bowl with 1 cup water. Soak 30 minutes, until rehydrated. Drain, reserving water, and chop.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the reserved sun-dried tomato water with enough water to yield 1 1/2 cups. Bring to a boil. Stir in the couscous. Cover, remove from heat, and allow to sit 5 minutes, until liquid has been absorbed. Gently fluff with a fork.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet. Stir in the sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, and green onions. Cook and stir about 5 minutes, until the green onions are tender. Mix in the basil, cilantro, and lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper. Mix in the mushrooms, and continue cooking 3 to 5 minutes. Toss with the cooked couscous to serve.</li>
