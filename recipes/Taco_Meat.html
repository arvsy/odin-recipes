        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>These crispy ground beef tacos are filled with seasoned meat, lettuce, cheese and tomatoes. 
      An easy dinner recipe that the whole family will enjoy, even your pickiest eaters! Includes a 
      recipe for ground beef taco seasoning.</p>
    <p>My beef tacos are so much better than the fast food version, especially when you use homemade 
      taco seasoning instead of the store bought kind. Best of all, this dinner can be on the table in 20 minutes.</p>
